    Organized an annual event for the Filipino-American community at the Shrine of Our Lady of the Island, Eastport, NY

I initiated and organized a traditional Filipino religious procession for the Filipino-American community on Long Island in 2017. As part of a family team, my duties included planning and coordinating with the Shrine; gathering of youth and young adult participants and their families; advertising; and decorating flower arches. The process took place over a one-month period. With over 200 attendees, coming from all over Long Island, Queens, and Brooklyn, the first annual Flores de Mayo and Santacruzan was a great success and has now become a staple for the Filipino-American community at the Shrine of Our Lady of the Island.
