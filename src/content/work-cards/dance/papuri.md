    "Papuri sa Diyos" was presented during the Gloria at the Mass for the Feast of San Lorenzo Ruiz at St. Patrickâ€™s Cathedral on September 25, 2014, before presiders Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, and Archbishop Auza, the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations. I coordinated and choreographed the dance, which included several groups ranging in age, background, and faith.
