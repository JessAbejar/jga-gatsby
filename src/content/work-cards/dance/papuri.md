    "Papuri sa Diyos" was presented during the Gloria at the Mass for the Feast of San Lorenzo Ruiz at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on September 25, 2014, before presiders Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, and Archbishop Auza, the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations. I coordinated and choreographed the dance, which included several groups ranging in age, background, and faith.
