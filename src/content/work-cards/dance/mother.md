    "Mother" is a meditation reflection that depicts the story of the life of Jesus Christ told through the eyes of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The piece uses movement, music, narrative, and costume to enhance this beautiful story told from a unique perspective. I have performed this dance worldwide, including at the Youth Festival at World Youth Day 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, shown here.
