    The Moving Prayer is a sacred dance company that I founded in 2013 after fulfilling a childhood dream of dancing at World Youth Day. Since then, I have shared the gift of dance through presentations and workshops offered around the world, encouraging people to nurture and uplift their mind, body, and spirit while also helping individuals discover and share their talents and follow their dreams.
