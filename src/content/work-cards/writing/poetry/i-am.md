    This poem was written and performed for TAGALOGUE, a performance of original monologues and dialogues of Filipinos living in the United States. "I Am, version 2.1" is a Filipina-American's confrontation with the "Identity Crisis," featuring the Girl of Today and the Filipina in Her Veins. The performance took place at the Nuyorican Poets Café, New York, NY, in October 2012. The original was a solo piece performed for the inaugural Filipino-American Heritage Month Celebration at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in October 2009.
